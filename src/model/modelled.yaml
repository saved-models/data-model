  #' It is decidedly unclear if this is the best way to do this
  #' The current data model means that we define a bunch of identifiers,
  #' which are either modelled, collected, or descriptive.
  # 
  #' The count of fish could actually be either modelled, or collected.
  #' In the current model, then, what we would do is define some
  #' count_fish variant in both the modelled and collected schemata.
  #
  #' Whether we *should* unify these into a single column identifier
  #' (which could be a completely different measure depending on the
  #' sampling frame) is an open question, but for these examples, define
  #' it here in the meantime...
  #
  #' I believe that the sampling frame should be up to the implementation
  #' of that column. I.e., here, the interpolated count of fish does not
  #' depend on the period being sampled, whereas the fo_lice example does.
