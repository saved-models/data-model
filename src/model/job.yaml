# Initial hypothetical type of job:
#
# Unlike manifests which actually verify data *against* well-defined
# schemata, the job manifest is explicitly data in and of itself,
# verified against this schema. The aim is to generate JSON-LD or RDF
# from this schema + manifest, which is then processed by the RAP.
#
# Here is what the LinkML documentation says:
# [https://linkml.io/linkml/faq/general.html#is-linkml-just-for-metadata]
#
#' "LinkML doesn’t draw any hard and fast distinction between data and
#' metadata, recognizing that “metadata” is often defined in relative
#' terms."
#
# Some, perhaps most of the identifiers located in this part of the data
# model should probably be moved to 'core' (not 'descriptive').
